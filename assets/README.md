# Portfolio Assets

This folder contains assets referenced in the portfolio.

## Current Files
- `scott-floyd-resume.pdf` - Resume document

## Missing Files (Referenced in Projects)
The following PDF files are referenced in the project cards but need to be obtained from the original repository:

- `a2-task-analysis.pdf` - City of Ann Arbor Website Task Analysis
- `usability-report-summary.pdf` - Photobook Usability Report  
- `boogie-battle-report.pdf` - Boogie Battle Mobile App Report

## Note
Until these PDF files are added, the project cards will link to non-existent files. The case study pages (rent-all-case-study.html and cyclist-case-study.html) work correctly as they contain the full content.
