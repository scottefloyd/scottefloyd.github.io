This is a placeholder file. In a real implementation, you would place Scott Floyd's actual resume PDF here. 
Since binary files cannot be generated in this format, you should:

1. Create Scott's resume as a PDF document
2. Place it in the assets/ directory
3. Ensure the download link in the HTML points to the correct path

The resume should highlight:
- QA Automation expertise with Playwright
- AI/GenAI consulting experience  
- UX/UI design background
- Relevant projects and achievements
- Technical skills and certifications
- Contact information
