- heading "My Story" [level=2]
- paragraph: As I grew up, my imagination was fed with a steady diet of Popular Science and Engineering magazines, James Bond movies, Inspector Gadget cartoons, and a healthy dose of MacGyver episodes. These weren't just entertainmentâ€”they were blueprints for possibility.
- paragraph: "The curiosity these sources inspired continues today, but with a twist: what seemed like pure science fiction in those magazines is now reality. Voice-activated assistants, AI that writes code, devices that fit in your pocket yet possess more computing power than entire buildings once held."
- paragraph: The desire to invent and improve runs deep in the American spiritâ€”it's as fundamental as apple pie.
- paragraph: That mindset shapes everything I do today. I'm not just using toolsâ€”I'm imagining new ways to solve old challenges. Every project becomes a chance to channel that childhood wonder into real solutions that make people's lives better.
